# EE2024-Assignment-2

Written as part of EE2024, Programming for Computer Interfaces, in collaboration with Ang Zhi Yuan.

There are three separate implementations.

## Implementation using systick

The first implementation uses systick for the timing of events with a few interrupts.

## Implementation using interrupts

The second implementation uses interrupts for the entire system, which explains the relatively empty main() function.

## Implementation using FreeRTOS

The third implementation uses FreeRTOS for timing control with other interrupts for critical devices.

## Disclaimer

This project is to be used only as a reference by future students. The implementations are ordered in increasing difficulty and you should only use up to a level at which you are comfortable.
